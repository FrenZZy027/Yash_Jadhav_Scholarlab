This project consists of 2 scens: "ChemLab and Cards
scene "ChemLab" is assignment 1
scene "Cards" is assignment 2

In Assignment 1, I have implemented the requirements of the given assignment;
The conical flask A activates and animates and moves on the cylinder and then we need to click on "the test tube".
A Pour button pops up which enables the pouring animation, then a Shake button pops up which enables the shake animation on flask B, which then is followed by the colour change in the liquid
then the player indicates Excitement on his face and a sound effect plays,
Then we need to click on flask B which then moves up, pushing back the flask A, same process is to be followed as with the Flask A.

In Assignment 2, I have implemented the requirements of the 2nd given assignment;
You can just start playing by dragging the images in the correct or your desired wish of Buckets, once all images are done then you are presented with the score


both builds (chemlab and cards) work on windows and android
no additional setups required or dependencies
